# References (brief)

This boilerplate is inspired by:
- A “Ralph Wiggum” style loop that repeatedly runs an agent via CLI and exits early on a sentinel.
- An Anthropic note on “effective harnesses” recommending an initializer step + a coding-agent step,
  plus durable artifacts (`init.sh`, a progress log, and a feature list).

Short snippets (for provenance):
- Transcript: “pass it a plans PRD.json… This is a JSON file with a bunch of different user stories in it.”
- Transcript: “Another important file… is progress.txt… a free text log… memory for this sprint.”
- Anthropic: “two-part solution: 1) Initializer agent… init.sh… claude-progress.txt… initial git commit…”
